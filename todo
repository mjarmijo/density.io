get sqllite container running
start db in sqllite, check it and query
make the request


some issue still in the dockerfile
can't get networking between containers to work
not sure what the problem is


Maybe need to hcange the name from localhost or 0.0.0.0 
to a name of the group, or task and it will start working
thinking docker on docker compose.
